# Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where two players can play against each other.

## Features
- Two-player mode (1 vs 1).
- Interactive and user-friendly UI.
- Simple yet responsive design.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the game.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic implementation.

## How to Play
1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. The game board consists of a 3x3 grid.
3. Player 1 plays as "X", and Player 2 plays as "O".
4. Players take turns clicking on an empty cell to make their move.
5. The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
6. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
7. Click the "Restart" button to play again.
