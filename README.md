# Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where you can play against the computer.

## Features
- Play against an AI opponent.
- Interactive and user-friendly UI.
- Simple yet responsive design.
- Randomized AI moves to provide a challenging experience.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the game.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic and AI implementation.

## How to Play
1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. The game board consists of a 3x3 grid.
3. You play as "X", and the computer plays as "O".
4. Click on an empty cell to make your move.
5. The AI will respond with its move.
6. The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
7. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
8. Click the "Restart" button to play again.
